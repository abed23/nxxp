Int power;
power = voltage x current;

Where the voltage and current have already been defined and are readings from the ADC Inputs  of the Arduino so are constantly changing.
This will mean I will have a constantly changing power value.
How do I put my first 100 calculates values of power into an Array?
Any help really appreciated thank you !
void setup() {
  // put your setup code here, to run once:

}

void loop() {
  // put your main code here, to run repeatedly:
